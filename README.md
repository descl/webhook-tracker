webhook-tracker
===============

A WebHook for mandril which will send you an email for each event (open/click...) on your sended mails via Mandrill


This wehook is based on http://help.mandrill.com/entries/21738186-Introduction-to-Webhooks

It's for me a really good way to know when my contacts read my mails and click on links.. When your contact read the mail you send him. You should call him ;).
